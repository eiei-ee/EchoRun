# Changelog

All notable changes to ECHO//RUN are documented here. This project follows
semantic versioning once a candidate is actually tagged; an entry marked
"local candidate" is not a published release.

## [v0.2.0-alpha.1] - local candidate - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Versioned, immutable active-generation snapshots with a separately trained
  pending generation.
- Six-stage Echo Duel flow: detection, reveal, resistance, counterattack,
  rewrite, and finale.
- Contract stability, counterattack reset, live prediction, fuzzy-echo clarity,
  finite course targets, and two-hit collision recovery.

### Changed

- Challenges target roughly 190 seconds; calibration targets roughly 75
  seconds using the runtime acceleration curve.
- Failed or abandoned retries retain the exact active opponent and pace.
- Lane contracts count dedicated marker coins only.
- Lane style is measured relative to generated route incentives.
- Director feedback matures by traversed distance, excludes contract-rewritten
  plans, and keeps turns obstacle-free under pressure.

### Validation

- EditMode: 190/190 passed.
- PlayMode: 19/19 passed.
- Clean local WebGL build succeeded and entered visible gameplay over local
  HTTP with no browser-console warnings or errors.
